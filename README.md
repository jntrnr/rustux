# rustux

A thought experiment in creating a Rust-based Linux distro.

## Picking the distro

For this experiment, I picked arch linux as it felt like the easiest way to start with a known, well-supported base. You could also use some of the Linux-from-scratch style distros.

For the installation of Arch, I chose to only install the basic graphical system without installing any desktops. We'll pick our window manager later.
